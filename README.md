# pl-interoperability
Comparing the interoperability of Golang with C/C++ and Python with C/C++

### Benchmarks to test
- Generate different DNA sequences
- Calculate spectral-norm
- Matrix Multiplication
- polynomial computing
- regex-benchmark

Benchmark these tests in: Go, CPython, CGo, CPython w/ C extensions and compare results.
- time: Ruby script
- memory: Ruby script
- cpu
  - python: ???
  - golang: pprof https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/#StartCPUProfile


### Golang
Benefits of using Golang?
- Very fast compile time
- Concurrency support at the language level
- Garbage Collection is implemented
- Extremely scalable: Go is built out of asynchronous tasks with message passing 
- Overall sort of like a low-level language with high-level syntax 

### Golang with C
cgo command
- Enables for the creation of Go packages that call C code
- Generate code to access C library functions and global variables
- Go's solution for integration with exiting software, infrastructure, and protocols

Points of interest to investigate
- Go is a garbage collected runtime while C is not. Passing data must be done carefully
- Call overhead: compare function call overhead differences between just Go vs CGo

### CPython3 with C
- CPython itself is written in C so there is a Python API that allows access to most aspects of Python's runtime system
- Writing C modules for Python allows for two major benefits:
  1. New built-in object types
  2. Ability to call C library functions and system calls
